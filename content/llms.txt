# LittleClusters

LittleClusters is a platform for learning distributed systems and databases through incremental,
project-based challenges. Developers build real distributed systems (consensus-based
stores, leaderless caches, message queues, blockchains, CRDTs) in any language,
verified by behavioral tests that simulate network failures, crashes, and real-world
scenarios.
